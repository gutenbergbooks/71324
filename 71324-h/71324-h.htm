<p>In the present issue of this work such errors and misprints as the
writer or others have noted in earlier editions are corrected, while
the supplement has been extended sixty-five pages by the insertion
of thirteen hundred and twenty names in excess of those included in
the fourth edition. Wherever needful the entries in this portion of
the volume have been materially amplified, and this has occurred in
numerous instances, while throughout the book there have been supplied
many dates of deaths happening since the first issue of the Dictionary,
in 1897. Since that year the work has been enlarged to the extent of
one hundred and forty-six pages of addenda in all, and though it still
falls much short of perfection in its line, the writer trusts that it
will yet be found responsive to all reasonable requirements that may be
made upon it.</p>

</div>


<p>The present volume is an outgrowth of the writer’s “Handbook of
American Authors,” first published in 1884, several features which
the judgment of the public approved in the earlier work having been
retained in this. Without pretending to contain an exhaustive list of
American writers, it may nevertheless lay claim to be fairly inclusive,
as the more than six thousand names herein mentioned will serve to
show. A few names that might naturally be looked for here have been
omitted at the request of their owners; while some others have not been
included, for the reason that diligent search failed to discover any
trustworthy data concerning them. Here and there, too, the reader may
chance upon unfilled dates of birth, or initials unexpanded. Yet in
the majority of such cases application by letter made directly to the
owners of the names aforesaid, or to relatives and immediate friends of
such persons, has failed to elicit any response. All reasonable effort
has been made to obtain trustworthy information upon such points,
but failure to obtain replies to letters of inquiry must account for
the greater number of such omissions; and here it may not be out of
place to mention that information of more general character obtained
from private sources has now and then been received too late to be
of service, owing to the fact that the work was already electrotyped
before it came to hand.</p>

<p>In a comprehensive work like this, including so large a number of
names and so many thousand dates, errors must of necessity occur, and
the author cannot hope to escape adverse criticism in this respect.
While absolute accuracy would have been impossible to attain, he has
nevertheless taken no little pains to approach this ideal; and to
this end, besides resorting to the ordinary means of information,
he has consulted hundreds of catalogues of libraries, colleges, and
publishers, as well as denominational year-books, and in numberless
instances has availed himself of trustworthy information received
directly from private sources. It thus happens that in certain cases
dates given in this volume differ from those in other works of
reference, and where this occurs the reason for the adoption of a
different date herein is supported by excellent authority.</p>

<p>It has been thought advisable to retain the “u” in the spelling of
such words as “colour,” “favour,” and the like, the exceptions to
this occurring in titles where the spelling of the original has been
followed. In connection with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span> it may not be amiss to note that
the original spelling of titles has been very commonly though not
invariably retained. To have done this in every instance, however,
would have entailed more labour than it was desirable to incur.</p>

<p>For several reasons the author has thought best in his classification
of certain authors to discriminate between poets and verse-writers. To
apply the name of poet to each and every writer of verse would have
been manifestly unjust. The poets of a generation are not numerous, but
the verse-writers are very many. If the term “poet” be loosely applied
it loses its signification, while to deny that name to many a writer of
excellent verse is to do him no injustice, but rather a service, as it
is no disparagement to a private soldier not to be addressed as colonel.</p>

<p>To the many persons who have so cordially responded to his letters
of inquiry, and whom he may not thank by name, the writer desires in
this place to express his acknowledgments. To Mr. Arthur Mason Knapp,
the superintendent of the Bates Hall department of the Boston Public
Library, he has been indebted for very much in the way of help and
suggestion from the time the work was begun, and to other officials of
that department he is under obligations likewise. He also gratefully
acknowledges much timely assistance received from the publishing firms
of Lee &amp; Shepard, T. Y. Crowell &amp; Co., and Lamson, Wolffe &amp; Co. In the
reading of the proofs many valuable suggestions have been received
from the proof-readers at the Riverside Press; but his especial thanks
are due his friend, Mr. Francis H. Allen, of Boston, whose watchful,
critical supervision has been exercised upon every page of proof from
first to last. The debt of gratitude which the writer owes him for this
service may not be lightly estimated. Without his help, the book would
have fallen far short of whatever measure of excellence it may now be
judged to attain.</p>

manner, however, where not laboured, is attractive and often dramatic.

<li><b>Bryant, William Cullen.</b> <i>Ms.</i>, 1794-1878. A poet and

of law, but soon abandoned it for journalism and, removing to New
York in 1825, became in 1828 the editor of the Evening Post, with
which he remained associated until his death. His earliest poem, The
Embargo, a political satire, was published when its author was but
thirteen, but the first collection of his poems was not made until
1821, the famous Thanatopsis being one of the eight which the volume
comprised. The quantity of Bryant’s verse is small, the quality high,
but not uniformly so. Its tone is usually calmly philosophic, and
it rarely makes any very effective appeal to the sympathies, its
coldness arising partly from lack of humour, partly from natural
reserve. The Embargo; The Spanish Revolution; The Ages; The Fountain
of Youth, and Other Poems; The White-Footed Deer; The Flood of Years;

Library in 1731, the American Philosophical Society in 1744, and was
one of the founders in 1749 of the institution which in 1753 became
the University of Pennsylvania. In 1753 he was appointed, jointly
with William Hunter, postmaster-general of the colonies. He was twice
sent to London as colonial agent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> for Pennsylvania, and in 1770 was

is a series of papers of the type of those in The Spectator, but
furnishing much more lively reading. Poor Richard’s Almanac, published

<li><b>Hopkins, Samuel.</b> <i>Ct.</i>, 1721-1803. A Congregational
clergyman of Newport, Rhode Island, the founder of what has been called
Hopkinsian Divinity, which differed from Calvinism in maintaining
the free agency of sinners, the moral inability of the unregenerate,
and ascribing the essence of sin to the disposition and purpose
of the mind. His views had great influence in the modification of
contemporary thought. He was a strong opponent of slavery, and his
influence procured the passage of a law prohibiting the importation
of slaves into Rhode Island. The System of Doctrine contained in
Divine Revelation is his principal work. Others are, The True State of
the Unregenerate; Nature of True Holiness; The Duty and Interest of
American States to Emancipate their Slaves. <i>See Life by Park; Mrs.

Boston, was a graduate of Harvard in 1844, and in 1846 explored the
wilderness beyond the Rocky Mountains, The Oregon Trail resulting from
this journey. For many years he was partially blind, but as far as
possible continued the historical work which he was meditating, while
as a relaxation he devoted much time to horticulture and published
a Book of Roses in 1866. The work of his life was the series of
historical narratives called France and England in North America, begun
in 1864 and completed in 1892. The work includes, in their order,
Pioneers of France in the New World; The Jesuits in North America; La
Salle and the Discovery of the Great West; The Old Régime in Canada;
Count Frontenac and New France under Louis XIV.; A Half Century of
Conflict; Montcalm and Wolfe. The Conspiracy of Pontiac forms a sequel
to the work, though first issued in 1857. The picturesque charm of his
style has been widely acknowledged, while his scholarship has never
been questioned. <i>See Life and Uncollected Papers, by Farnham; Life

<li><b>Stowe, Mrs. Harriet Elizabeth [Beecher].</b> <i>Ct.</i>, 1811-1896.
Wife of C. E. Stowe, <i>supra</i>, and daughter of Lyman Beecher,
<i>supra</i>. In 1836 she was married to Professor Stowe at Cincinnati,
and, in frequent visits to the slave States at that period, acquired
a knowledge of Southern customs. In 1850 she removed to Brunswick,
Maine, and, having by this time become deeply impressed with the
wrong of slavery, she wrote Uncle Tom’s Cabin for The National Era at
Washington, in which paper it appeared serially from June, 1851, till
April, 1852. It was then published in book form and speedily became
world-famous, five hundred thousand copies being sold in America within
five years, while translations of it appeared in twenty languages. As a
moral agent few books have been of so much importance. From a literary
point of view there is less to be said of it; and The Minister’s
Wooing, a novel of the early days of the republic, must rank as her
finest work. The quality of her other work is uneven, its highest level
being represented by Oldtown Folks; The Pearl of Orr’s Island; Dred;
The Chimney Corner; Religious Poems, among which is the well-known
hymn, “Still, still with Thee.” Her lesser works comprise, My Wife and
I; Sam Lawson’s Fireside Stories; We and Our Neighbors; Little Foxes;

<li><b>Whitman, Walter</b> [commonly <b>Walt</b>]. <i>N. Y.</i>, 1819-1892.
A poet regarding whose claims to the title much controversy has raged.
During the Civil War he served as a volunteer nurse in the Washington
hospitals, and, after holding a government clerkship till 1873,
removed to Camden, New Jersey, where the rest of his life was passed.
Leaves of Grass, his first book, appeared in 1855, a vigourous protest
against established rules of versification in its utter formlessness.
Drum Taps, which included the now famous Lincoln elegies, When Lilacs
Last in the Dooryard Bloomed, and O Captain, My Captain, followed in
1865. The republication of his poems in England in 1868 aroused instant
attention there, and excited extravagant praise in some quarters.
His rejection of rhyme and metre will probably always repel the mass
of readers. His later works include, After All Not to Create Only;
A Passage to India; As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free; Two Rivulets;
November Boughs; Good Bye My Fancy; Sands at Seventy; Specimen Days and
Collect; in prose, Franklin Evans, or the Inebriate; Democratic Vistas;
Memoranda During the War. <i>See O’Connor’s Good Gray Poet; Burroughs’s

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
